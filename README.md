# TruckSim Profile Manager

*TruckSim Profile Manager* is a tiny tool to manage save game profiles for *Euro Truck Simulator 2* and *American Truck Simulator*.

It can 

- copy existing profiles to new ones, 
- delete existing profiles,
- backup profiles to a zip compressed file.

I made *TruckSim Profile Manager* because I didnÂ´t find another tool, which was able to achieve this in a easy way.

## Installation

Download the latest version from Github [releases](https://github.com/elpatron68/TruckSim-PM/releases). Extract the ZIP file in a directory of your choice. Start `TruckSim-PM.exe` to launch the program.

## Disable Steam Cloud Usage

You must disable Steam Cloud usage for each profile. To stop using Steam Could: Start the game and at the profile selection screen select your profile then edit profile and uncheck the Steam Clould checkbox..

## Usage

Should be self-explanatory, just right-click on a profile.
