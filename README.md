# TruckSim Profile Manager

*TruckSim Profile Manager* is a tiny tool to manage save game profiles for *Euro Truck Simulator 2* and *American Truck Simulator*.

It can 

- copy existing profiles to new ones, 
- delete existing profiles,
- backup profiles to a zip compressed file.

I made *TruckSim Profile Manager* because I didnÂ´t find another tool, which was able to achieve this in a easy way.

## Installation

- Download the latest version from Github [releases](https://github.com/elpatron68/TruckSim-PM/releases). 
- Extract the ZIP file in a directory of your choice. 
- Start `TruckSim-PM.exe` to launch the program.

## Disable Steam Cloud Usage

You must disable Steam Cloud usage for each profile. To stop using Steam Cloud: Start the game and at the profile selection screen select your profile, then edit profile and uncheck the Steam Cloud checkbox:

## Usage

Should be self-explanatory, just right-click on a profile:

### Copy Profile

Asks for a new user name, decrypts `profle.sii`, replaces user name and copies the selected profile to a new one.

### Delete Profile

Deletes the selected profile directory.

### Backup Profile

Asks for a file name and archives the selected profile directory to a zip file. Restore by extracting the file to the profiles directory.

### Decrypt profile.sii

Decrypt the profile configuration file (for manual editing).

## Privacy Statement

As the author likes to know, if and how often this app is being used, a simple usage tracking was implemented. Absolutely no personal information (like directory- or user names or IP addresses) will be submitted.
